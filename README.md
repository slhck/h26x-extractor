# h26x-extractor

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/h26x-extractor.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/h26x-extractor)

Author: Werner Robitza, with contributions from @chemag, Paulo Sherring, Thomas Jammet.

Extracts NAL units from H.264 bitstreams and decodes their type and content, if supported.

⚠️ `h26x-extractor` is neither fast nor robust to bitstream errors. It's rather a playground for parsing bitstreams. Use with caution! This program is no longer maintained, PRs are welcome.

## Installation

Requirements: Python 3.8 or higher

Via pip:

    pip3 install h26x-extractor

## Status

Currently supported:

- Parsing of H.264 bitstreams
- Parsing of NALU
- Parsing of AUD
- Parsing of CodedSlice(s)
- Parsing of SPS
- Parsing of PPS

Currently planned:

- Parsing of SEI
- Parsing of H.265 bitstreams

## Usage

If you installed the program via pip, you can run it directly:

    h26x-extractor [options] <input-file>...

Otherwise you can clone this repo and run it via:

    python3 -m h264_extractor [options] <input-file>...

You can pass the `-v` flag to enable verbose output, e.g. the following. You will get, for each NAL unit:

- The byte position range
- The offset from the start of the stream
- The overall length including start code
- The type (also translated in plaintext)
- Its content in raw bytes, encoded as hex
- Its RBSP content
- A table with its content decoded, if supported

Example:

    NALU bytepos:   [0, 28]
    NALU offset:    0 Bytes
    NALU length:    29 Bytes (including start code)
    NALU type:      7 (Sequence parameter set)
    NALU bytes:     0x0000000167f4000d919b28283f6022000003000200000300641e28532c
    NALU RBSP:      0xf4000d919b28283f602200000002000000641e28532c

    SPS (payload size: 22.0 Bytes)
    +--------------------------------------+---------+
    | field                                | value   |
    +======================================+=========+
    | constraint_set0_flag                 | 0       |
    +--------------------------------------+---------+
    | constraint_set1_flag                 | 0       |
    +--------------------------------------+---------+
    ....

## Programmatic usage

You can also use this library in your code, e.g.:

```python
from h26x_extractor.h26x_parser import H26xParser

def do_something(nalu):
    pass
    # do something with the NALU instance

H26xParser.set_callback("nalu", do_something)
H26xParser.parse()
```

The callback is called for each type of info found. Valid callbacks are:

- `sps`
- `pps`
- `slice`
- `aud`
- `nalu`

The callback returns an instance of the NALU type. You can access the `s` property to get the whole data including the RBSP.

You can also call the `nalutypes` classes to decode the individual fields, e.g. `nalutypes.SPS`:

```python
from h26x_extractor.nalutypes import SPS
from bitstring import BitStream

nal_payload = "0x0000000167f4000d919b28283f6022000003000200000300641e28532c"
sps = SPS(BitStream(nal_payload))
sps.print_verbose()
```

## Alternatives

[h264bitstream](https://github.com/aizvorski/h264bitstream) is a proper H.264 parser.

FFmpeg can also parse bitstream data:

```
ffmpeg -i video.h264 -c copy -bsf:v trace_headers -f null - 2> output.txt
```
